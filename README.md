# Hands-on Introduction to Machine Learning

This is the code of the video http://youtu.be/b9MpfFFfnTI

--- 

We will show all the steps that a data scientist takes to solve a machine learning problem, in a fast but also detailed manner.

The idea is to show the thought process and the reasons behind the actions and the decisions taken. We will start applying basic models and end in state-of-the-art deep neural networks.

In this first video we will cover the very basics: setting up the work environment, downloading, loading and observing the data, explain how a machine learning pipeline works at its core and build some basic baseline models.
